# Reading files

This is my first file that really got me intrigued with python. Hooked ever since. Something easy to learn how to read files.

Make sure to have Python3+ installed and proper directory 

```bash
check for latest version $ python --version
```

## Usage

```python
from sys import argv

script, filename = argv

txt = open(filename)
```
